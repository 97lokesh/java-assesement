                1.Movie Class:

I’ve defined a Movie class with a constructor that takes title, studio, and an optional rating (defaulting to “PG”).
There’s also a static method getPG that filters an array of movies to return only those with a “PG” rating.
I created an instance of Movie called casinoRoyale with the title “Casino Royale,” studio “Eon Productions,” and a rating of “PG-13.”
        2.Circle Class (UML to TypeScript):
        
I provided a UML diagram for a Circle class, and I’ll convert it to TypeScript:

In this TypeScript class, pi is defined as 3.1412, and the methods calculate the area and circumference of the circle.
        3.Person Class:
        
I created a Person class with a constructor that takes name, age, and country.
The displayDetails method prints the person’s name, age, and country.
I instantiated two persons: person1 with details “Francisca Rohan,” 25 years old, from the USA, and person2 with details “Raimond Aruna,” 30 years old, from the Netherlands.
      4.UberPrice Class:
      
I defined an UberPrice class with properties for base price, kilometers, and tax.
However, I  haven’t implemented any methods or logic within this class.
